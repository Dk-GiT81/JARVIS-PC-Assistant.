# JARVIS-PC-Assistant

Welcome to the JARVIS - PC Assistant project! This repository contains the code and resources for a cutting-edge project developed to enhance user interaction with the computer. This project was developed to create a voice-activated personal assistant using advanced speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies for PC. JARVIS aims to provide a seamless and intuitive solution for performing tasks like opening websites, playing music, and fetching news headlines through simple voice commands.


## Introduction

This project leverages advanced speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to create a voice-activated personal assistant. The primary goal is to streamline everyday computer tasks, making them more efficient and accessible through intuitive voice commands.

## Features

~ Voice-Activated Commands: Open popular websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Gmail with voice commands.

~ Music Playback: Play your favorite songs from a predefined music library.

~ News Fetching: Get the latest news headlines read out loud using the News API.


## Installation

i. Clone the repository:

```cmd
    git clone

  	https://github.com/Dk-GiT81/JARVIS-PC-Assistant.git
  	cd JARVIS-PC-Assistant
```

ii. Create and activate a virtual environment:
Creating a virtual environment ensures that your project dependencies are isolated from other projects and system-wide packages.

```cmd
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
```

iii. Install the required dependencies:
With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to install the necessary packages.

```cmd
        pip install -r requirements.txt
```

iv. Verify the installation:
Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly by running the following command

```cmd
         pip list
```

v. Run the JARVIS assistant:
Start the JARVIS assistant by running the main script:
```cmd
        python jarvis.py
```

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up and installed a virtual environment for the JARVIS - PC Assistant project, ensuring a clean and isolated development environment.
