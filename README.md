    Introduction

 This project leverages advanced speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to create a voice-activated personal assistant. The primary goal is to streamline everyday computer tasks, making them more efficient and accessible through intuitive voice commands.
 

    Features

  •	Voice-Activated Commands: Open popular websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Gmail with voice commands.
  
  •	Music Playback: Play your favorite songs from a predefined music library.
  
  •	News Fetching: Get the latest news headlines read out loud using the News API.




To set up the project locally, follow these steps:


1.Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your_github_link/JARVIS-PC-Assistant.git
    cd JARVIS-PC-Assistant

2.Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Usage:
To start the JARVIS assistant, run the following command:

    python jarvis.py

*The assistant will initialize and start listening for the wake word "Jarvis." Once activated, you can use voice commands to perform various tasks.


      Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.	Clone the repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

    git clone

  	https://github.com/Dk-GiT81/JARVIS-PC-Assistant.git

  	      cd JARVIS-PC-Assistant

   
3.	Create and activate a virtual environment:
Creating a virtual environment ensures that your project dependencies are isolated from other projects and system-wide packages.

        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate


4.	Install the required dependencies:
With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt


5.	Verify the installation:
Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly by running the following command:

        pip list

You should see a list of installed packages that match the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.


5.	Run the JARVIS assistant:
Start the JARVIS assistant by running the main script:

        python jarvis.py


By following these steps, you will have successfully set up and installed a virtual environment for the JARVIS - PC Assistant project, ensuring a clean and isolated development environment.
